/**
 * Android-specific implementation of the LocalManagerProvider composable function.
 *
 * This implementation initializes the platform-specific manager instances required
 * by the application and provides them to the composition hierarchy through
 * CompositionLocal providers. The function handles the creation and provision of:
 *
 * - AppReviewManager: For managing in-app review requests through Google Play
 * - IntentManager: For handling Android-specific intent operations
 * - AppUpdateManager: For managing application updates through Google Play
 *
 * The function retrieves the current Activity from the provided AppContext and uses
 * it to initialize each manager implementation. All managers are then made available
 * to child composables through their respective CompositionLocal providers.
 *
 * @param context The Android Context used to initialize the managers
 * @param content The composable content where the managers will be available
